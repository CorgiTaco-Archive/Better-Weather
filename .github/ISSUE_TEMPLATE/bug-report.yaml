        **Prior to filling out this bug report please try the following:**
        -Reset your configs! Configurations typically change between mod updates and are typically the most common causes of crashes. To reset your configs, move your existing configs to a seperate directory that isn't your MC installation directory, run the game, and update the values from your old config in the newly generated config!

        -Isolate this mod on its own and attempt to reproduce the crash with the mod. If it works on its own, this is more than likely a mod incompatibility. Please make sure to mention whether or not this is a mod incompatibility in the "What Happened" section of this issue!
